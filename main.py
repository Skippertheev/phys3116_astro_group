## NEW PART

# Now, let us create a plot of the disperision vs. magnitude to see if a FJ curve will appear for all of the galaxies
ds_red = print(type0)

df = pd.DataFrame(merged_galaxy)

df.plot(x='m_r_kin', y='vsigma_max', kind='scatter')
plt.show()

# Running this shows no linear trend, and therefore, our FJ curve must be created with our refined data

print(type0)

df = pd.DataFrame(type0)

df.plot(x='m_r_kin', y='vsigma_max', kind='scatter')
plt.show()

# Curiously, running this still gives just as random a scattering, just with less points. This indicates, that the 
# data is still unrefined or the the m_r_kin is the incorrect magnitude to use or vsigma_max is the incorrect
# dispersion to be used. This will be a point of discussion into next weeks meeting to understand why that data is
# wrong.

# Keep only elliptical galaxies
df = merged_galaxy[merged_galaxy['type'] == 0].copy()

# Filter for ellipticity between 0.2 and 0.8 (best elliptical galaxies)
df = df[(df['ellip_kin'] > 0.2) & (df['ellip_kin'] < 0.8)]

# Drop rows with missing values in key columns (cleans data to not run into problems when plotting and analysing,
# like breaking mathematical operations and skewing results) --> replaced third variable because it is not relevant
df = df.dropna(subset=['sigma_re', 'm_r_kin', 'mstar_kin'])

# Upon some reflection, one of the reasons that the practice FJ curve may not have worked is because the dispersion is
# meant to be to the power of four. A further reason for the failure is that the relationship is between dispersion^4
# and luminosity.


# The conversion between Magnitude and Luminosity is given as: L=(L_o)*10**(0.4((M_o)-M))
# For M_o = abs. magnitude of the sun (= 4.85), L_o = luminosity of the sun (3.83*10**26), M = abs. magnitude of each
# selected galaxy

   return (3.83*10**26)*10**(1.932-0.4*x)

# This should now have two data frames for luminosity and for the dispersion^4.

# NOTE: After some discussion, we concluded that it the conversion may not be necesssary (as is explained below), 


# Base Faber–Jackson Relation plot using both L∝σ^4 and M∝σ^4 (same as logL=m*logσ+b). The given formula assumes a linear relationship, 
# and since M is inversly proportional to luminosity, the graph with luminosity values is flipped for a clear representation

# 'sigma_re' is how much the speeds of stars inside a galaxy differ from each other
# 'm_r_kin' is the apparent luminosity of a galaxy in the red filter
# 'mstar_kin' is stellar magnitude calculated from velocity dispersion and radius
# I think the variables are already in log form?


# Scatter plot: apparent luminosity vs velocity dispersion (the higher the velocity dispersion the lower the luminosity)
# Allowing vs code to show me multiple windows with graphs at the same time
